## Why Go

* Statically typed
* Fast builds
* Great performance
* Good at concurrency
* Good at networking and building distributed systems
* Garbage Collected: Dijkstra's On-the-fly algorithm, sub-millisecond stop-the-world
* Great tooling: easy AST, goimports, gofmt, golint, go test, guru, etc
* 100% written in Go

---

## Goal of Go

* **performance** and **safety** of a statically typed compiled language
* **expressiveness** and **convinience** of a dynamically typed interpretted language

---

## Go is a small language

* Easy to learn
* Hard to make mistakes
* Easy to read, as opposed to write (eg Ruby)
